<p>This makes for an instant wedding ring when the fingers become too swollen to accommodate the engagement and wedding rings. Posted by 11 months ago. MW said that they would just cover the rings in tape. When my mom was pregnant with my sister they had to get her wedding ring cut off. Rings and swollen fingers. Your ring should be sized so its not hurting you when your hands do swell but not falling offeasily removable when it is colder out. Pin On Only Mine.</p>

<p>Therefore take the ring off and rock the tan line. It is the sad part of pregnancy where I have to take off my rings. Complications such as pre eclampsia can contribute to swelling as well.

<p>If you do experience swelling in the hands you will likely have to stop wearing your wedding ring. Posted by 11 months ago. I thought only the fleshy part of the finger swelled during pregnancy. Then slowly twist the ring around and around until it slowly moves up and off your finger. When it gets really bad I take them both off and wear my wedding band on my right hand instead. Try to get the dish soap underneath of your ring which will help a lot. Pin On Wedding Ring.</p>
