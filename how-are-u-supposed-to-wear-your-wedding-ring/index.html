<p>In western cultures the correct way to wear a wedding ring set is engagement and wedding rings are worn on. When you know your engagement ring wont be exposed to harsh chemicals or unnecessary pressure its okay to leave it on. So there are basically two things you can do with your engagement ring during the wedding ceremony. The first is to simply wear it on your right ring finger which is what I prefer. Some even choose to wear them separately one on each hand. Wearing it around your neck on a chain is a common way to symbolic keep your spouse close. Pin On Some Day.</p>
