When you are going to the doctor too many times and have several tests to get through wearing the wedding ring could be unsafe which makes keeping the ring off a safe option. My husband doesnt wear a wedding ring after having to get his last two cut off because of work. Him not wearing it usually means something other than a lack of commitment. Maybe she does hand labor and doesnt want to wear the ring out or she works somewhere that no one can wear jewelry because of safety or scratching on the product being made.

<p>UnfaithfulnessInfidelity in quite a few cases is a reason why a married woman has stopped wearing her ring. It seems as though he spends less time with his ring on than off. If your man refuses to wear a wedding ring dont jump to the conclusion that hes less committed to you than he should be and just waiting for his chance to run off with someone else. It does bother me so I decided to protest and took mine off a long while back. Although not wearing a wedding ring is often a simple and innocent oversight on the part of a wife it can also be a sign of much marital dissatisfaction lurking deep in her heart. 29062013 at 852 pm.
