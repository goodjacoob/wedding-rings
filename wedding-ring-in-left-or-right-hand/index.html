<p>Just like the left hand people wear their engagement rings on the fourth finger or ring finger of the right hand. Thats the tradition we follow here in India. Some couples use the same finger as the engagement and wedding ringsthe fourth finger of the left handbut since this isnt an official engagement others opt for a different finger.

<p>In Latin the word sinister means on the left side. For men and women the engagement ring and wedding ring go on the left hand. All terms point to the same third finger of the left hand. Some reasons that people might wear their wedding rings on the right hand versus the left hand or vice versa include. The left-handed ring finger was believed to be connected to the heart by a vein so wearing a ring on that finger signified to the world that the wearer had a claim to their heart. The right hand is the blessed hand Jesus ascended to sit on Gods right hand side and you are blessed by the right hand of the priest. Pin On Rings.</p>
