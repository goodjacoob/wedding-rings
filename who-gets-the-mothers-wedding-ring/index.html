<p>However my sister is very upset and claims a right to the ring. Besides he has two daughters what do you want to bet the other daughter 19 yrs old will want the engagement ring when she finds out if the sister gets the diamond wedding band. Most families find themselves conflicting on who gets the mothers ring. Along comes my niece whose fiance somehow wrangles these diamonds out of. At the hospital the mans mother gifts the bride to be her engagement and wedding ring set which is a family heirloom she wishes to keep in the family. But in this age with lots of couples having no kids or lots of divorces that muddies the waters so to speak-LOL. Pin On Thomas Sabo.</p>

<p>In former times it was a tradition for the eldest son to inherit the engagement ring supposedly with the notion that it will be used for his future wife and the eldest daughter inherits the wedding band. Burial is a ceremonial way to dispose of a loved ones remains so the idea of placing valuables in the casket whether its a wedding ring or a medallion or even fancy clothing is one that we accept with relative ease. Or something that your mom wore every day that meant a lot to her. My sister took my moms wedding band for the same purpose so we each have one of her rings. My mother had inherited her mothers diamond and she also had hers from her wedding band set After dad died she took it off. If your brother took the engagement ring maybe you can have the wedding band. Pin On Rose Gold.</p>
