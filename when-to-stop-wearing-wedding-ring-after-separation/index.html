<p>I sometimes look at the closed drawer and wonder. Id say when you feel the divorce proceedings are irreversible. Your reasons for wearing or removing the rings are yours alone. Some remove it after the divorce is final. If your spouse claims they dont care consider informing them of when you plan to take the ring off. Technically no one HAS to wear a ring if they are married. When To Remove Your Wedding Band After Divorce.</p>

<p>Do you still wear your wedding ring when separated. I took it off in front of her and dropped it into my dresser drawer where it still resides. If you are still officially married I believe you are still married in the eyes of God. The wife continues to use her husbands name if she has taken it and both spouses usually continue to wear their wedding rings. You may wear them until you finally decide that they no longer feel true. I sometimes look at the closed drawer and wonder. Why Should You Never Take Off Your Wedding Ring.</p>
