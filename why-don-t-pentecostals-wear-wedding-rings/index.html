<p>Perhaps the fear of some women is that their man not wearing his ring is a form of unfaithfulness Or at least that it could lead to such a thing. A lot of traditional Pentecostals believe in modesty. There is no real reason to wear a ring. I personally do not like wear the ring too mafan. So because the church generally stands against the use of jewelry they have not been in favor of the use of wedding rings. Im pouring myself a glass of water when I hear a friend question my husband Where is your wedding ring The tone of her voice is accusatory.
