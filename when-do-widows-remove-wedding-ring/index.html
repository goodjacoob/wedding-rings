<p>If you do feel that you are able. In the end I took it to a jeweler and made two pendants out of them one for me and one for our daughter. John wore a ring that we bought together engraved with our initials and the date of our marriage. Many widows wear their wedding rings till the day they die and others take them off the first year. See how this feels to you. And some people choose to remove the rings store them in a safe place and hope one day to.

<p>Some prefer to move their wedding ring to the right hand instead. I know widows and widowers who wear their wedding rings forever some who switch it to another finger or hand and some who wear it around their neck. Professionals recommend a widow only remove her wedding ring once she feels that the time is right. And some people choose to remove the rings store them in a safe place and hope one day to. There really is no right time to take off your wedding ring after the death of your spouse. But thats really not an ironclad rule.

<p>It was a struggle between wanting to move on and wanting to hang on between having someone to love and no one to love. A ritual which draws on traditional liturgy could ease the pain of this process. I know people who got remarried and they just moved this wedding ring to the other hand. Many widows wear their wedding rings till the day they die and others take them off the first year. Whichever the case whether a widow wants to keep wearing her ring or wants to take it off it is a personal decision. No etiquette can guide the proper time to remove it.
